# numBERTpy
This repository is proposing a fully working BERT architecture completely implemented from scratch in NumPy for Text Classification and completely equivalent to the one proposed by HuggingFace.
You'll be able to better understand the behind the scenes of these complex models by looking at a scratch implementation using a mathematical library like Numpy and also you'll find the code to be better managed than what it's proposed as a single file in other libraries implementations.

I also added a class in order to load and convert weights from a Pytorch saved model and load them in the NumPy tensors of the model.

This work is the product of an other research project I've been working on.

For any question or issue please contact me!

Thanks to [Numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy), [Pytorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) and [HuggingFace](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)!
